# Sequencer plugin for AttractMode front end

by [Keil Miller Jr](http://keilmiller.com)

## DESCRIPTION:

Sequencer plugin is for the [AttractMode](http://attractmode.org) front end. It selects a random game after a period of inactivity.

## Paths

You may need to change file paths as necessary as each platform (windows, mac, linux) has a slightly different directory structure.

## Install Files

1. Copy plugin files to `$HOME/.attract/plugins/Sequencer/`.
2. The [Helpers module](https://github.com/keilmillerjr/helpers-module) is **REQUIRED** for you to install. The plugin will not work correctly without it.

## Usage

You can enable the Sequencer plugin by running Attract Mode and pressing the tab key to enter the configure menu. Navigate to `Plug-ins -> Sequencer -> Enabled`. Enable the plugin.

## Notes

More functionality is expected as it meets my needs. If you have an idea of something to add that might benefit a wide range of layout developers, please join the [AttractMode forum](http://forum.attractmode.org/) and send [me](http://forum.attractmode.org/index.php?action=profile;u=32) a message.
